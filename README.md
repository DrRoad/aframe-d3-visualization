# Visualizing in VR using Aâ€‘Frame and D3

I was interested in seeing what a compelling visualization in 3D, and by extension in VR, might look like. In this demo, one learns about various cities by exploring a terrain. The fake data is encoded using elevation at the city-level. Turning your head, which you can either do with a headset or by clicking and dragging your mouse, and looking at a mound of black sand provides some insight into that city.
